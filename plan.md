# Plan: Creating, Maintaining Repo and Activity 14 Deliverables

## Goals
1. Create a clear record of Activity #14 deliverables.

## Steps
- Branching: use `dev` for work; use `main` for stable content.
- Issues: create at least two issues.
- Pull requests: open PR from `dev` to `main` with description linking to issues.
- Commits: use clear, meaningful commit messages.

## Maintenance
- Periodic updates on `dev`, then PR to `main`.
- Use Issues to track tasks and close them from PR descriptions by referencing `#issue_number`.

## Activity 14 Integration
- Attach Activity #14 - Tiago Rundle (STAT 184).pdf and TiagoRundleActivity14.qmd to the `develop` branch.
- Provide a short summary in README and in this plan.
